**Abstract**.  In most cases, the diagnosis of brain disorders such as epilepsy is slow and requires endless visits to doctors and EEG technicians.  This project aims to automate brain disorder diagnosis by using  Artificial Intelligence and deep learning.  Brain could have many disorders that can be detected by reading an Electroencephalography.  Using an EEG device and collecting the electrical signals directly from the brain with a non-invasive procedure gives significant information about  its health.  Classifying and detecting anomalies on these signals is what currently doctors do when reading an Electroencephalography.  With the right amount of data and the use of Artificial Intelligence, it could be possible to learn and classify these signals into groups like (i.e: anxiety, epilepsy spikes, etc).  Then, a trained Neural Network to interpret those signals and identify evidence of a disorder to finally automate the detection and classification of those disorders found.
